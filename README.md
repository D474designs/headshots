Throw balls at your opponent's face!

# About

Developed by [Remy Sharp](http://github.com/remy) of [Left Logic](http://leftlogic.com), [Head Shots](https://headshots.leftlogic.com) was originally a Chrome Experiment for Google IO 2013.

Head Shots aims to show off the new and exciting technology available in mobile and desktop devices in the very near future.

This project includes:

* WebRTC for live video streaming (via getUserMedia)
* WebRTC for data (via RTCDataChannel)
* WebSockets for initial handshaking & fallback streaming
* Orientation events
* CSS3 animations
* HTML5 canvas using Three.js
* Node.js on the server for real-time support

All of the code is available on github and licensed under [MIT](http://leftlogic.mit-license.org): [http://github.com/leftlogic/headshots](http://github.com/leftlogic/headshots)

All graphic work was done by [Sebastian Hermida](http://www.happyprog.com), and special thanks to [Seb Lee-Delisle](http://seb.ly) for his help with Three.js.
